This will explain the basics of git and the most common commands you will use 

# First time git setup:
Commands:

cd <path-on-your-computer>
git clone https://github.com/mzamora1/CSE-360-Team-Project.git
cd CSE-360-Team-Project

(modify project somehow)

git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin master:main

These commands assume you have already congifured git on your machine. (ie. add a global username and email)
If you havent done so, see ./git-push.sh on how to configure git for first time use.
It is reccomended to use git-bash.exe if using Windows (usually located at C:\Program Files\Git\git-bash.exe).


# Status
Command:
git status

This will display the status of your local git repository and show commands that may be useful.
Use this command if youre unsure what has been added or if git produces weird errors


# Pull
Command:
git pull https://github.com/mzamora1/CSE-360-Team-Project.git main 

This will merge the current state of the main branch with the local files you have on your computer
Invoke this command every time you open the project before you start making changes OR after someone else has pushed changes to the repository


# Add
Command:
git add .

This will stage all files not excluded in .gitignore so they can be tracked for changes by git.
This does not upload anything to GitHub.
Invoke this command after you add or modify a new file to the project
Files that need to be added will have a U on the right in vs-code
Files that have already been added will have an A on the right in vs-code


# Commit
Command:
git commit -m "message"

This will prepare the tracked changes to be pushed to the remote repository.
Essentially creates a snapshot of the files in the staging area and assigns hash key.
This does not upload anything to GitHub.
To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.
Invoke this command before you push

Command: 
git commit -am "message"

This automatically stages files that have been modified and deleted, but new files
you have not told Git about are not affected.
Invoke this command after you modify an already added file (ie. files with M on the right in vs-code)


# Push
Command:
git push origin master:main

This uploads the local branch master to the remote branch main on GitHub.

If this command gives an error like this: `
    fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

    Please make sure you have the correct access rights
    and the repository exists.
`
then you must add a new remote origin using git remote.
Invoke after git commit.

Command:
git push origin main

Use this push command if git --version > 2.25.1


# Remote
Command:
git remote add origin https://github.com/mzamora1/CSE-360-Team-Project.git

This tells git where you want to upload your commits to. In this case we upload to our project repository.
